  <h1><span style="color: red">Personal Interests:</span></h1>
  <p>There are many things in life that interest me, but what I show in the list are among the best.  I love to be outside
    alot, and also on the go.  I love the outdoors, I love to hunt, fish, and camp.  I also love to fire up a good video
    game during the weekend to relax and relieve stress.  Most importantly, I do know how to prioritize my obligations, so
    I know when to stop playing and start doing my work.</p>
