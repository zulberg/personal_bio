<p>Growing up, I was always interested in technology.  I wanted to pursue a career in a field with potential for the long term.  From
  a personal perspective, I was always shy from grade school all through high school.  I never was much of a social person, I mostly
  kept to myself as much as I could.  From a professional perspective, I was fortunate enough to work for Lockheed Martin's Information
  Systems Department for a decade.  I got in at the tail end of the tech boom, but I had to migrate to San Jose, CA to work there.  While
  working there, I learned a great deal about IT and related fields, and eventually became inspired to finish college and see how far I have
  the potential to go. </p>
